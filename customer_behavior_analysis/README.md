📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data by performing data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.
The project concludes with a structured report and presentation to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.
